This directory contains a set of scripts designed to launch
several benchmarks using SLURM and multiple nodes.

All output is write to a tmp dir and then copied over at
the end of the runs.

Expected directory structure:

```
rodinia - {bfs, hotspot, kmeans, etc.} - sac
nas     - {EP, CG, MG, FT}
```
Because we are using SLURM, we can create batch scripts to
(a) compile the source code, (b) launch it with a varienty
of parameters, and (c) collect the output into an amenable
format to send back to the host.

Specifically, the source code is compiled and run based open
a _profile_ which describes what flags to use and what input
or flags to pass to the binary. The binary is intentionally
run in `/tmp` to save on IO cost. After it has been run, the
data is copied back in a compressed form for later viewing.




#OLD IDEA ---->
All code is compiled using the compile script, which ensures
that we use the same compilation flags throughout. The binaries
are then copied to `bin` and named using the following format:

```
%benchmark%-%suite%-%varient%.out
```

_The %varient% key indicates what SaC target was used_.

All the benchmarks then can be run using the `run` script. It
will go through `bin` and execute the files. Because we are using
SLURM, it will in practice
